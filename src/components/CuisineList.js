        para: "It is considered as the primary food item that is compulsorily available in the large traditional Assamese thali. The dish is non-vegetarian which is a meat delicacy; prepared from the khaar itself which is the primary ingredient mixed with raw papaya, taro, and pulses. Then all the above items are filtered with dried banana leaves for adding a kind of distinct flavour into it. This specific dish can be eaten with rice and generally included in the lunch menu."

        para: "This dish is also non-vegetation and is perfect to have during summers. The term 'Tenga' means sour and the reason for the sourness is because tomatoes, dried mangosteen, lemon, raw mango, and elephant-apple are added into it. The dish isn't that spiced but fenugreek, 5 mixed spices (panch phoran), and mustard seeds are added to add some flavour. It has a subtle sense of taste, sour fish curry which is best to have during lunch or dinner. It also helps in enhancing digestion."
